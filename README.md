# API Capstone Restaurant
Capstone Project about API's

Combine the skills and knowledge and use them to build an API for the Little Lemon restaurant. 

Purposal:

Little Lemon's management wants to develop an online-based order management system and mobile application. 
I will need to create the back-end API that allows customers to browse food items, view the item of the day and place orders. 
Managers need to be able to update the item of the day and monitor orders and assign deliveries. 
And the delivery crew should be able to check the orders assigned to them and update an order once it’s delivered.
